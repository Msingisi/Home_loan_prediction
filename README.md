# Introduction

Loans constitute the fundamental business of banks, with the primary source of profit being the interest accrued on loans. Before granting a loan, financial institutions engage in a thorough process of verification and validation. Despite this, there remains uncertainty regarding whether the applicant possesses the capability to repay the loan without encountering difficulties. In this project, I construct a predictive model aimed at determining whether an applicant is likely to repay the loan to the lending company.
